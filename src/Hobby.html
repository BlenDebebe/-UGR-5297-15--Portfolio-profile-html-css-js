            <p> I enjoy watching Korean movies and dancing to Korean music.</p>
            <p> Since high school, I have attended the Korean Cultural Festival numerous times.</p>
            <p>  I am fluent in the Korean language, able to read and write Hangul proficiently.</p>

            <p>Hiking is one of my favorite activities to do on the weekends. The mesmerizing beauty of the mountains surrounding Addis relaxes me and brings me a sense of peace. It is an experience that always makes me feel rejuvenated. Since I live in Naro Ajamba, the mountain is nearby, and we have a clear view of it even from our home. It adds beauty to the area.

            <p>I believe that as long as someone is alive and well, they should also have the ability to support others.One volunteer activity I am particularly passionate about is blood donation. 
                Since turning sixteen, I have donated blood five times.</p>
